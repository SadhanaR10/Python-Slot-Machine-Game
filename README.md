This project is a terminal-based Slot Machine Game built in Python. It’s designed to help beginners learn Python by creating an interactive and functional game.

**In the game:**

1.The player deposits money.

2.Chooses how many lines to bet on (1–3).

3.Sets a bet amount per line.

4.The game then “spins” virtual reels (symbols generated randomly).

5.If matching symbols appear in a line, the player wins money based on the symbol’s payout.

6.The game updates the balance, and the player can choose to continue or quit.

This simple idea introduces key programming skills — input validation, loops, functions, randomization, and condition checking — all in one cohesive project.
